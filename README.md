My usage of chatGPT to create a fully functional website



## Created GitHub repository and began working on code!
### March 18, 2023
The hope is to see how much chatGPT can create with as little editing from myself as possible. Short of database management, and some content editing I will refrain from interfering with the code that GPT creates. If chatGPT gives code that I do not like, I will prompt it to adjust it directly.

Most of this code will be created with GPT-3.5, but if errors persist in any code, I will attempt to use GPT-4.0. I will note any code that uses GPT-4.0.

Finally, I am extremely new at coding, which is why I am posting this onto GitHub, so that I may recieve insight and suggestions from more experienced people!
