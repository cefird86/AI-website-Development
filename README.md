# chatGPTwebsite
My usage of chatGPT to create a fully functional website

The hope is to see how much chatGPT can create with as little editing from myself as possible. Short of database management, and some content editing I will refrain from interfering with the code that GPT creates. If chatGPT gives code that I do not like, I will prompt it to adjust it directly.

Most of this code will be created with GPT-3.5, but if errors persist in any code, I will attempt to use GPT-4.0. I will note any code that uses GPT-4.0.

Finally, I am extremely new at coding, which is why I am posting this onto GitHub, so that I may recieve insight and suggestions from more experienced people!

# Creating the index.php *and* about.php
Told GPT to create a basic index.php file with a header and footer. It did so without issue, all I had to do was ask it to adjust the content to be centered.

I did the same with the about.php file. I even asked it to include the content about what chatGPT's abilities were.

# Had GPT create a login system, and a basic game
I started with some issues with the login system, because I manually entered login data into the database, but when chatGPT created the login.php file, it was looking for a hashed password, so I had chatGPT create a signup.php page and ensured that it hashed the password before passing it to the database. This fixed the issue.

I had GPT create a hangman game, which I had no issues in uploading and implementing. My next step is getting a graphic placed on the page so that the hangman game looks like a hangman game!
